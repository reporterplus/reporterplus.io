  <h2>What is ReporterPlus?</h2>
  <p>
    ReporterPlus is a set of small, composable tools built around pytest test results.
    Each component does one thing well and produces stable artifacts you fully own.

  <h2>Choose your workflow</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>HTML reports</h3>
    <p>
    Generate in less than 3 seconds a fast, unified, mobile-friendly pytest HTML report with automatic screenshots.
    No hooks, no merge plugins, no configuration — works out of the box with xdist.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>VS Code integration</h3>
      <p>
  VS Code extension for pytest-html-plus that shows failed tests in a sidebar and lets you
  jump directly to the failure location. Designed for fast local debugging — it complements
  the HTML report instead of replacing it.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>CI automation</h3>
      <p>
  GitHub Action to collect, upload, and publish pytest-html-plus reports from CI runs.
  Automatically publishes unified HTML reports and artifacts for every workflow —
  no custom scripts, no merge steps, and works out of the box with parallel (xdist) runs.
